# Imitation Learning

The [imitation](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/imitation) library implements
imitation learning algorithms on top of Stable-Baselines3, including:

- Behavioral Cloning
- [DAgger](https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.0686) with synthetic examples
- [Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.11248) (AIRL)
- [Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03476) (GAIL)
- [Deep RL from Human Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03741) (DRLHP)

You can install imitation with `pip install imitation`. The [imitation
documentation](https://imitation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) has more details
on how to use the library, including [a quick start guide](https://imitation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/first-steps.html)
for the impatient.
